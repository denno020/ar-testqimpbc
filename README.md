# ar-testqimpbc

Auto generated repository for testing a Marker Based AR implementation.

To view, open https://denno020.github.io/ar-testqimpbc/ on your phone.

You'll then need to aim the phone at https://ar-js-org.github.io/studio/assets/default-marker.png to see the AR snowman

The model itself isn't great, as it's not centred within the viewport, so rotating it actually rotates the whole thing around a centre point, rather than around its own centrepoint
